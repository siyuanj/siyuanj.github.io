## About Me

Hi, my name is Jiang Siyuan (蒋思源), currently an junior undergraduate student at Tsinghua University, Tanwei College, majoring in chemical Biology for Pharmaceutical Science.

Currently, I am in Professor Yigong Shi's lab. I am interested in computational biology, especially protein design and evolution. I welcome any discussions about related topics! Feel free to reach out!

## Research Interests

My primary research interests include:

- **Computational Protein Design:** Sequence design and structure prediction, focusing on functional scaffolding and linkers.
- **Structural Biology:** Spatiotemporal evolution of protein complexes and auxiliary scaffold design for structure determination.
- **Enzyme Engineering:** Spatially organizing multi-enzyme cascades to enhance substrate channeling and reaction rates.

## Research Experience

**High-Throughput Screening of Functional Food-Derived Peptides**
*School of Life Sciences, THU | Advisor: Assoc. Researcher Yafei Yuan*
- Developing a multi-stage screening pipeline for bioactive peptides using lightweight pre-screening models and **AlphaFold 3** for structural validation.

**Spatiotemporal Evolution of the Gamma-Secretase Complex**
*School of Life Sciences, THU | Advisor: Prof. Yigong Shi*
- Investigating the evolutionary assembly pathway of the gamma-secretase complex tetramer and constructing phylogenetic trees to trace evolutionary history.

**T-cell Specific In-situ CRISPR Screening System**
*School of Pharmaceutical Science, THU | Advisor: Prof. Xuebin Liao*
- Established an in-situ screening platform using gene-edited ESCs to dissect the dynamic regulation of T cell exhaustion and metabolic-epigenetic coupling.

**iGEM Competition: In-situ RNA Quantification Tool**
*Department of Chemical Engineering, THU | Advisor: Prof. Chun Li*
- Developed a yeast-based RNA quantification tool using ADAR protein, offering a faster, non-destructive alternative to qPCR.

## Honors and Awards

- **WeiGuang Program, Individual Excellence Award**, Tsinghua University (Jun 2025)
- **Gold Award for the Practical Detachment**, Tanwei College (Jan 2025)
- **Comprehensive Excellence Award** (University Scholarship, Top 20%), Tsinghua University (Nov 2024)
- **Gold Medal**, International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM) (Oct 2024)

## Hobbies

Beyond research, I maintain an active lifestyle and diverse interests:
- **Sports:** I am a member of the **Tsinghua University Diving Association** and the Tanwei College **Badminton Team**. I also enjoy running and swimming.
- **Arts & Culture:** I love Rock Music, J-Pop, and Sci-Fi films (e.g., *The Matrix*, *Star Wars*).
